# ðŸ§‰ ARED - Argentinian Real Estate Datset


Argentina's economic history, marked by crises like the "Rodrigazo" in the 1970s, has led to the dominance of the US dollar in real estate transactions. Recent policies have further shaped the market dynamics configuring a unique scenario. ARED aims to provide quarterly snapshots of the Argentinian real estate market, including both listing features as well as images, filling a gap in available datasets.
